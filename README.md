### ðŸš§ðŸš§ Looking for maintainers and backers ðŸš§ðŸš§

See this [issue](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera/issues/3000)

We are looking for maintainers for this package, or to depreciate this in favor of [react-native-vision-camera](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera) or [expo-camera](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/camera/), if nobody want to maintain this package.

## Docs
Follow our docs here [https://react-native-camera.github.io/react-native-camera/](https://react-native-camera.github.io/react-native-camera/)

The comprehensive camera module for React Native.

Supports:

- photographs.
- videos
- face detection (Android & iOS only)
- barcode scanning
- text recognition (optional installation for iOS using CocoaPods)

### Example import

```jsx
import { RNCamera, FaceDetector } from 'react-native-camera';
```

#### How to use master branch?

We recommend using the releases from npm, however if you need some features that are not published on npm yet you can install react-native-camera from git.
